# Image Gallery 

This project is a responsive image gallery built using React, React Router DOM, and Axios. It allows users to browse through a collection of photos, view details about each photo, and enjoy a visually pleasing gallery experience.

## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- Navigation through different routes facilitated by React Router DOM.
- Fetching and displaying a list of photos from a remote API using Axios.
- Displaying individual photo details on a separate detail page.
