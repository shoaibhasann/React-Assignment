# React Counter Web Application

This is a simple web application built using React to implement a counter functionality with increment and decrement buttons. The counter value is displayed in the user interface and updates in real-time when incremented or decremented. React's state management, components, and hooks are utilized to achieve this functionality.

   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

The application consists of a counter and two buttons:

- **Increment Button:** Clicking this button increments the counter value by one.
- **Decrement Button:** Clicking this button decrements the counter value by one.

The counter value is displayed in real-time on the user interface.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html): Used to manage state and handle button click events.
